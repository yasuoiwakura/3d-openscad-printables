# 3d-openscad-printables
A small printables-as-code library of assorted parametric OpenSCAD models

## Problem
1. STL-Models on makerworld etc. are fix
3. Modifications using Slicer Apps are bothersome and often inaccurate
3. Buying Fusion360 not quite cheap (plus closed source)

## solution approach
Design-as-Code approach OpenSCAD[https://openscad.org/] enabling parameters, logic and use Git versioning. It also can export STL-Files for your Slicer.
Creating them can by time-consuming (even with ai), so I'm publishing my objects here for personal use.
